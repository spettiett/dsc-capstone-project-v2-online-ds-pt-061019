    "# Begin Study\n",
    "> In this notebook I will use the 'Lazy Predict' algorithm to build several baseline models with basic feature engineering. This study will examine the hotel booking dataset from a kernel in Kaggle. The objective is to build a lot of basic models without much code which helps to understand which models work better without any parameter tuning."
